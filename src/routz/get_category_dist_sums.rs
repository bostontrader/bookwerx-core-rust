/*
Given a comma delimited list of category_id, find all the distributions related to all accounts tagged as _all_ of the given categories, optionally filtered by time, and calculate and return the sum of the distributions for each particular account. Recall that the returned sums will be expressed using a decimal floating point format.

A list of categories of one entry is merely a special case of the above, without a comma, and should work the same way.

Given an optional boolean decorate param, return extra decorative related fields such as account title and currency symbol.

Given an optional time_stop parameter, filter the above distributions such that
distribution.time <= time_stop before computing the sum.

Given an optional time_start parameter, filter the above distributions such that
time_start <= distribution.time before computing the sum.

Omitting both time_* params gives us a very simple call to find the balance _right now_!

Setting the time_stop param let's us compute a balance as of a certain time and is what we do for
balance sheet items.

Setting both time_* params gives us the change in balance during a time period and is what we do for
 income statement items.

Setting only time_start doesn't seem real useful, but I'm sure somebody can find a need for doing this.
