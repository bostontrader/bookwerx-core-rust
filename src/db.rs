/*
We have a blizzard of structs for a variety of reasons.  Unfortunately, it's rather tedious to
manage them.  Please allow me to enumerate the problems and solutions.

Some of the structs are substantially similar to the underlying db row that they model. Naming them is reasonably easy.  However, many structs have "decorations".  That is, account names, currency symbols, and other similar related info.  Naming these is not easy, especially since we tend to many similar variations.

In addition, these structs also have a variety of derives.  These derives have accumulated over the eons and there's no good way to determine if any of them are unused. Granted, an unused derive does not have significant consequence.  But it does offend my finely honed sense of aesthetics and that's reason enough to fret about this.

What we have here now is my one-time pass over all of this to cleanup whatever chaos lurks within.  It's the best I can reasonably do with this foul situation.

many derives.
